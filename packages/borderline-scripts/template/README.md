This project was bootstrapped with [Borderline create extension](https://github.com/dsi-icl/borderline-create-extension).

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:
```
my-extension/
    README.md
    node_modules/
    package.json
    server-extension/
        index.js
    ui-extension/
        index.js
        
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the extension in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your extension is ready to be deployed!
